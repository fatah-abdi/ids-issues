Classification in intrusion detection systems (IDS) suffers from a major problem which is the unbalanced distribution of classes, since classifiers tend to favour the majority classes. Poorly represented types of attacks, let alone unknown attacks (“zero day attack”), are generally misclassified.
This work aims to generate new attack samples in order to balance the different classes and to predict non-existent classes using different methods: such as over-sampling (oversampling), sub-sampling (undersampling), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Generative Antagonist Networks (generative adversarial networks or GAN).
 The goal is to improve the performance of classifiers and especially to be able to anticipate unknown attacks.
